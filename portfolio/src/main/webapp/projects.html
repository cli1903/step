            <p> <b> Mining misdiagnosis patterns from biomedical literature. </b>
                <ul>
                    <li>extracted misdiagnosis patterns from PubMed article database using python</li>
                    <li>used QuickUMLS library to match disease names and NetworkX to graph and analyze misdiagnoses</li>
                </ul>

            <p> <b> CSCI1951a: Data Science - Predicting NFL Game Wins </b> 
                <ul>
                    <li> used SportRadar API to get NFL football game data for each team for each game </li>
                    <li> used the game data to train machine learning models to predict whether the home team would win based on the two teams' average stats from their previous 5 games </li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li> used data recorded from research lab at Brown University </li>
                    <li> used TensorFlow to train recurrent neural networks to see whether they could accurately predict a monkey's limb movement based on their neuron firing rates </li>
